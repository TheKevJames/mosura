Mosura
======

Mosura is an opinionated Task management frontend. Overall project goals are:

* **usage agnostic**: team members using Mosura should not conflict with those
  who do not
* **minimal views**: if you don't use a feature, it shouldn't bloat your
  interface or slow you down
* **opinionated workflows**: Mosura assumes you're looking for a simplified
  experience and trims out all the inessential cruft

I don't currently expect Mosura to be useful for anyone but myself. Maybe
eventually!

Usage
-----

First off, you'll need to `create a Jira API token`_.

Best run via docker/podman/etc:

.. code-block:: console

    docker run -d \
        --name=mosura \
        -p 8080:8080 \
        -v /path/to/appdata:/data \
        -e JIRA_DOMAIN=https://myinstance.atlassian.net \
        -e JIRA_AUTH_USER=myuser@example.com \
        -e JIRA_AUTH_TOKEN=mytoken123456 \
        -e JIRA_PROJECT=MOS \  # TODO: comma-separated list
        -e JIRA_LABEL_OKR=okr \  # (optional, default: okr)
        -e MOSURA_APPDATA=/data \  # (optional, default: .)
        -e MOSURA_PORT=8080 \  # (optional, default: 8080)
        -e MOSURA_HEADER_USER_EMAIL=X-Token-User-Email \
        --restart unless-stopped \
        quay.io/thekevjames/mosura:latest

# TODO: docker-compose, k8s

Can also be run locally for development purposes:

.. code-block:: console

    export ...
    export MOSURA_USER=...  # force the user without going through auth
    poetry install --sync
    poetry run uvicorn mosura.app:app --reload

Workflow Assumptions
--------------------

We make the following assumptions about your workflow / project setup. Note
that much of this section also doubles as a "TODO: make these configurable"
list.

Overall, we assume your project is configured at minimum with the following
fields:

* ``key``: eg. ``MOS-123``
* ``summary``: the short title of the ticket
* ``description``: the long-form body of the ticket
* ``status``: the current status of the ticket

  * if you use a ``Needs Triage`` value, it will get highlighted as requiring
    attention in the issue list and coloured red in the timeline
  * ``In Progress`` or ``Code Review`` will get coloured yellow in the timeline
  * ``Closed`` will be red on the chart and will not be visible anywhere else

* ``priority``: the determined priority of the ticket

  * ``Low``, ``Medium``, ``High``, and ``Urgent`` will get special icons

* ``assignee``: the assigned user

  * if the ``assignee`` matches your configured Jira credentials, the "my
    issues" page will work

* ``customfield_12161``: a.k.a. ``Start Date``; if anyone is aware of a builtin
  version of this, I'd love to switch over
* ``Original estimate``: the time estimate for the ticket

  * if a ticket has a start time and a time estimate, and that timespan is
    close to the current date (between a couple weeks in the past and a couple
    months in the future), it will get drawn onto the timeline

* ``components``: arbitrary list of components

  * if a ticket has no listed components, it will get highlighted as requiring
    attention

* ``labels``: arbitrary list of labels

  * if a ticket has no listed labels, it will get highlighted as requiring
    attention
  * if the label matches your configured "OKR Label" setting (default:
    ``okr``), ensure it appears on the timeline page

We also assume that you are interested in quarterly planning, using the
financial quarter model starting on February, eg. Q1 starts on February 1st and
the quarter's year is the one that Q4 will fall in (so 2022-02-01 is 2023Q1).
