Brainstorming
-------------

* implicit syncing; eg. Github PRs are tickets, issues are tickets, etc
* two-way syncing between jira/github/etc
* implit joining -- eg. commit message parsing to identify branch/commit/pr vs issues/jira/etc..
* pre-built configs w. customization, re-configure frontend to drop features you don't care about
* multiple first-class ingress points, eg. cli/webui/integrations/api
* different views for different roles (eg. developer vs PM vs QA vs ...)
* blocked on external things (eg. my ticket is blocked on dependency GH issue)
* public vs private tickets (permissions for out-of-org, etc)
* easy dependency trees
* arbitrary levels of nesting (eg. no "epics" vs "stories")
    * how does this deal with syncing?
